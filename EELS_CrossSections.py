    Egerton's original expressions (formula numbers given below) have been slightly reformulated by Mike Kundmann

    kinematics, and simplify the GOS expressions.  In order for the angular portion of any subsequent cross-section
    computation to be carried out via straightforward NumPy array integration with fixed limits of integration,
    the GOS table is computed versus scattering angle, theta, rather than (dimensionless) momentum transfer, qa0.
